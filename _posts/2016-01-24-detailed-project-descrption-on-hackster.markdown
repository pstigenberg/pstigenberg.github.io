A couple of days ago I added my box-project to my profile on [hackster.io] so now you can read a lot more details about the project. There's also a schematics over the electronics and some more pictures from the project.

I'll try to add more projects on my [profile page] as soon I get them to work... If everything goes according to plan, the next project will also also involve an RFID reader, but a different kind.
