description: A visit to Tinkersphere in east village New York. Hopefully we'll get a store like this in Sthlm someday as well.

During our visit in New York I visited [Tinkersphere], a small place with tools, sensors, boards and everything else you could possibly need. A fantastic place well worth a visit if you are in east village.  

The truth is that I went there twice, and bought a RPI, a couple of small Arduino boards and a a led matrix that will be used for my next project. 

Another nice thing with Tinkersphere is the 8-bit music they played in the store. I created my own tinkering [playlist] that will be played in the lab at home.
