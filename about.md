This will be short... 

I have a background as a developer mostly in C# but if you go way back also in C++, my frontend skills are limited, hence the quite basic look of this blog... 

During daytime I'm the CTO of a webb agency called Creuna, after work it's a lot of tinkering with electronics, arduinos and so on.  

All projects will be found on GitHub [github.com/pstigenberg](https://github.com/pstigenberg)
